# Rust Student Database

This project is a Rust command-line utility that allows users to manage a student database. It includes features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records. The project also demonstrates the use of GitHub Copilot and SQLite.

### Rust source code:

The code is written in idiomatic Rust and utilizes Rust's unique features such as ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. The code is also well-documented and easy to understand.

### SQLite Database:

The project uses an SQLite database to store student records. SQLite is a lightweight and easy-to-use database.

### GitHub Actions:

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow file that tests, builds, and lints the Rust code. This workflow ensures that the code is of high quality and that it meets the project's standards.

Dependencies:

The project has the following dependencies:

Rust
SQLite
rusqlite (Rust library for interacting with SQLite databases)

### How to run the program:

To run the program, you must first clone the repo. Once clone, you can run the program from the command line using the following command:

```Rust
 make all
```
The above will format,lint,test, install and finally run project. 

The following options will be displayed: 



To build the project binary, run 

```Rust 
make release
```


### How GitHub Copilot was used:

GitHub Copilot was used to generate code snippets and suggestions throughout the development process. This helped to improve the quality and efficiency of the code. For example, GitHub Copilot was used to generate the following code:

```Rust
fn create_student(conn: &Connection, name: &str, major: &str, grad_year: i32) -> Result<()> {
    conn.execute(
        "INSERT INTO students (name, major, grad_year) VALUES (?1, ?2, ?3)",
        [name, major, &grad_year],
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```
This code snippet was generated by GitHub Copilot after I typed the following code:

```Rust
fn create_student(conn: &Connection, name: &str, major: &str, grad_year: i32) -> Result<()> {
    // Insert student into database
    Ok(())
}
```

GitHub Copilot also generated suggestions for the names of variables, functions, and classes. This helped to make the code more readable and maintainable.

### Example Usage

### Additional 
We also created a postgres azure cloud database and provided the python connection and finalising the Rust CLI interaction with the cloud database

### Conclusion:

This project is a great example of how Rust, SQLite, and GitHub Copilot can be used to create a high-quality command-line utility. The project is easy to use and well-documented, and it includes a number of features that are useful for managing a student database.
